//Q2 - Add in some simple methods

//Q3 Create a companion Object

//INHERITANCE -
// How does it get passed down??
//Do you work down by surname, family tree or how??
//superclass at top like Grandfather / Grandmother
//Father / mother then children
//uncle & aunt and then cousins
//When you give something an additional class you can only do this one. This has drawbacks.
//If you have a book how could this look? page lengths, genres,
//How to create a class of books ? What would be the super book? key components that make up a book and what is additional?
//Author, title, genre - So many possibilities
// class Book essential is title & author)
