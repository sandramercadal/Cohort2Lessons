 If something needs to be used again and again we make it in a class.
 sometimes we only need one copy of something.
 In this case we can just make a new object

//CLASSES
// If we want to build something again and again like a blueprint. SO using it in different places throughout the code
//Always start with a  capital letter

class ClassDefinition (classpapameters: String) {
  //String is a type
  //(Optional) Class Body. if we wont we dont need curly brackets
  //Fields and methods go here - collectively called numbers
  //Must give default values.
}

//CLASS PARAMETERS
//We can pass in raw values ie values we would write in like age: Int
//or values we have already stored. WE could also pass another class!

//TYPE SAFETY
//Use classes as paramenters
//classes are handy for making the output more readable
//2 Ints or strings or booleans next to eachother as the output is difficult e.g 1,33"
//Every class likes its only file
//class Hamster ().....
